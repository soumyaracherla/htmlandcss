	<b> <u>Paragraph highlighting </b> </u> or marking is actually not just that <strike> yellow or light green background </strike>that you’d be smudging over the text but a lot more. For an avid reader it’s both the already read past and indication to take it for notice in the future. Paragraph highlighting – which should be correctly called <i>Paragraph Marking</i> – is the process in which you, while reading a book or according to someone’s instruction – tick a certain parts of chapter of a book. Highlighting can be done with colored highlighters, pencils, pens and certain symbol types.
